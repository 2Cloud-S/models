Voting preferences vary across demographic groups and are shaped by complex social factors. Using data from a March 2024 survey of 1,559 respondents, we examine what proportion of votes will be cast for Joe Biden in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.


```{r setup}
#| message: false
library (tidyverse)

poll_data <- tibble(biden = as.factor(c(rep("Yes", 655), 
                                        rep("No", 904)))) |> 
                slice_sample(prop = 1)

```
